    <p>Welcome to my travel blog! <br> This is a site where I share my adventures from around the world, as well as travel tips, guides, photos, videos, and much more. <br>

        I’m a full-time travel blogger from Pakistan (peshawar, to be exact). <br> But mostly, I’m just a guy with a passion for traveling and dreams to make a living out of it. <br> So far, it’s been working out pretty well, but I still have a long way to go. The journey never really ends.</p>

    <p>As a passionate traveller and blogger, I’m always looking for inspiration. <br> I love looking at travel photography blogs to learn more about new places, <br> see what other people are doing, and pick up tips and ideas for my own work.</p>
